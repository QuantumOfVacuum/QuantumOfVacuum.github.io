To me, the quantization of angular momentum in the 
[Bohr model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_model)
of hydrogen has always felt like a very _ad hoc_ assumption. To think that
[Niels Bohr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr) just happened to come up
with the correct quantization condition $$L_z = n \hbar$$, (which happens to be
identical to what is obtained from a quantum mechanical treatment) is absurd.

Elementary texts explain the quantization rule by appealing to the
constructive interference of electron waves (_the only orbits permitted
are the ones whose circumference is an integral multiple of the [de Broglie
wavelength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_wave) of the electron_). 
However, we note that [de
Broglie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_de_Broglie) formulated his
hypothesis more than a decade _after_ the Bohr model was proposed.

In this post, I want to start with the information available to Bohr at the
time (evidence for quantized energy levels from atomic spectra and the
empirical [Rydberg formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rydberg_formula)) and
get to the magical quantization rule with the 
[_correspondence principle_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_principle) 
(as Bohr did). 

The following section will start with Bohr's original postulates and establish
some notation, I will discuss the origin of the quantization in the next
section.


### Bohr's Postulates

We start with Bohr's assumptions in his own words:

> 1. That an atomic system can, and can only, exist permanently in a certain
>   series of states corresponding to a discontinuous series of values for its
>   energy, and that consequently any change of the energy of the system,
>   including emission and absorption of electromagnetic radiation, must take
>   place by a complete transition between two such states. These states will
>   be denoted as the _stationary states_ of the system.
>
> 2. That the radiation absorbed or emitted during a transition between two
>   stationary states is ''unifrequentic'' and possesses a frequency $$f$$,
>   given by the relation $$E' - E'' = hf$$, where $$h$$ is Planck's constant
>   and where $$E'$$ and $$E''$$ are the values of the energy in the two states
>   under consideration.

We note that both of the above assumptions are at odds with classical
electrodynamics because (1) accelerating charges radiate away their energy, and
electrons in an orbit around the nucleus must be accelerating; and
(2) the frequency of radiation given off by a periodically accelerating charge
should be the same as the frequency of acceleration.

A third assumption is the _corresponence principle_ which asserts that, as
microscopic systems become macroscopic, the results must go over to the
classical.

In order to estimate the energy of a stationary state, we equate the Coulomb
force on the electron and the centripetal force

$$
  \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{1}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r} \tag{1}
$$

which leads to the kinetic energy given by

$$
  T = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
    = \frac{1}{2} \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{1}{r}. \tag{2}
$$

The total energy is then given by

$$
  \begin{align}
    E & = T + V \\
      & = \frac{1}{2} \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{1}{r}
           - \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{1}{r} \\
      & = - \frac{1}{2} \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{1}{r} \tag{3}
  \end{align}
$$

We note that the only variable in the above equation is $$r$$. Hence if the
atomic energy levels are quantized, the atomic radius must also be quantized.
Due to the _second postulate_,  frequency of radiation $$f$$, emitted due to a
transition from energy $$E'$$ to $$E''$$ ($$E' > E''$$) is given by

$$
  \begin{align}
    hf & = E' - E'' \\
       & = \frac{1}{2} \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}
            \left( \frac{1}{r'} - \frac{1}{r''} \right)
            \label{e:frequency1} \tag{4}
  \end{align}
$$

where $$r'$$ and $$r''$$ are the atomic radii of the electron in states of
energy $$E'$$ and $$E''$$ respectively. Equation \eqref{e:frequency1}, along
with the Rydberg formula

$$
  \frac{1}{\lambda_{nm}} = R_H \left(\frac{1}{m^2} - \frac{1}{n^2}\right)\\
  \label{e:rydberg} \tag{5}
$$

where $$n$$ and $$m$$ are integers, and $$R_H$$ is a constant referred to as
the Rydberg constant which has the units of inverse length, can be used to
deduce the quantization of the atomic radii. Since, the frequency and
wavelength are related by $$f \lambda = c$$, where $$c$$ is the
speed of light, Equation \eqref{e:rydberg} can be
written in terms of the frequency as

$$
  h f_{nm} = c R_H \left(\frac{1}{m^2} - \frac{1}{n^2}\right) 
  \label{e:rydberg2} \tag{6}
$$

Expressions in Equations \eqref{e:frequency1} and \eqref{e:rydberg2} lead us to guess that
the orbital radii are quantized as

$$
  r_n = a_0 n^2 \tag{7}
$$

where $$n$$ is an integer and $$a_0$$ is a constant with units of length,
which for $$n = 1$$ gives the radius of the electron orbit in the lowest energy
stationary state and is called the Bohr radius.

Now, we need to calculate the Bohr radius. We stop here to note that this is
the point when elementary texts 'assume' the angular momentum quantization
rule, $$L_z = m_e v_n (a_0 n^2) = n \hbar$$ as a _third postulate_ to
derive an expression for $$a_0$$.  In this post however, we will use the
correspondence principle to derive and expression for $$a_0$$ and consequently the quantization rule.

### Origin of Angular Momentum Quantization

First, we note that the kinetic energy of the electron is quantized

$$
  T  = \frac{1}{2} m_e v_n^2 
     = \frac{1}{2} \frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{1}{a_0 n^2}.
       \tag{8} \label{e:kinetic}
$$

Next we recall that, according to classical electrodynamics the frequency of
radiation emitted from an oscillating charge is equal to the frequency of
oscillation of the charge. According to correspondence principle, the frequency
of radiation for transition between adjacent states given by _the second
postulate_, must approach the orbital frequency of the electron in its
stationary state for highly energetic states, that is, for large $$r_n$$.

The frequency of oscillation of the electron in an orbit of radius $$r_n$$ is

$$
  \begin{equation}
    f_{orbit}  = \frac{v_n}{2 \pi (a_0 n^2)} \label{e:forb} \tag{9}
  \end{equation}
$$

Next, we substitute for the velocity from Equation \eqref{e:kinetic}

$$
  f_{orbit}^2 = \frac{1}{4 \pi^2 n^4 a_0^2}
      \left[\frac{1}{m_e} \left(\frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}\right) 
        \frac{1}{n^2 a_0}\right] \label{e:forb2} \tag{10}
$$

The frequency of radiation emitted for transition between adjacent states
(between stationary states characterized by $$n$$ and $$n + 1$$) can
be calculated from the _second postulate_, and $$f_{radiation}^2$$ is given by

$$
  \begin{align}
    f_{radiation}^2 & = \left(\frac{1}{2} 
         \left(\frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \right)
         \frac{1}{h a_0} \left[\frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{1}{(n + 1)^2}\right]
       \right)^2 \\
       & = \left(\frac{1}{2}
             \left(\frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \right)
             \frac{1}{h a_0} \left[\frac{2n + 1}{n^2 (n + 1)^2} \right]
            \right)^2. \tag{11}
  \end{align}
$$

As $$n$$ becomes large, the expression becomes

$$
  \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} f_{radiation}^2
      = \left[ \left(\frac{e^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \right) \frac{1}{h a_0}
            \frac{1}{n^3}\right]^2
            \tag{12}
$$

which can be equated to $$f_{orbit}$$ and the resulting equation solved for 
$$a_0$$ to obtain

$$
  a_0 = (4 \pi \epsilon_0) \frac{\hbar^2}{m_e e^2} \tag{13}
$$

Finally, from Equations \eqref{e:forb} and \eqref{e:forb2}, the velocity of the
electron in the $$n$$th Bohr orbit is

$$
  v_n = \frac{\hbar}{m_e a_0} \frac{1}{n} \tag{14}
$$

and so the angular momentum is

$$
  \begin{align}
    L_z & = m_e v_n r_n \\
        & = m_e \left(\frac{\hbar}{m_e a_0} \frac{1}{n}\right) (n^2 a_0) \\
        & = n \hbar. \tag{15}
  \end{align}
$$
