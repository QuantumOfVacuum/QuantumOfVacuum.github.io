- (2021/01/28) Today we observe the full moon through binoculars. It was one of the biggest full moons that I've seen. So bad I don't have a good camera right now to take a picture of it.
- (2021/01/29) We have another full moon again. Sadly, the sky was a little cloudy. Orion's nebula was clear visible. Maybe tomorrow we will have a tripod for taking pictures. If weather is good, we plan to see Andromeda galaxy. I need to investigate if this is possible from the southern hemisphere first. Update: It's not possible right now. Andromeda is visible from October to December. Hope tomorrow we take some good pictures of moon at least.
- (2021/01/30) Today the sky was very cloudy before 8 pm. Then, the sky begin clearing but with some faint clouds. The moon is turning the quarter phase. At 10 pm the sky is almost cleared but the moon is fainted by some clouds. We receive the tripod today but didn't have the time to set the equiptment up. Tomorrow, definitely, we will post some photos of landscape and the moon (if time is favorable, of course).
- (2021/01/31) We had the possibility to test the tripod and it works just fine. We taked some photos of the mountains that sorround my city and the reiver that traverses it. At night, the sky was cloudy so we couldn't take photos.

- (2021/02/01) During the day the sky was really cloudy, not to mention the nightsky. It looks its going to be a cloudy week. We shall try to take photos of the mountains.
- (2021/02/02) The sky was clear gor about 30 minutes. In that time we manage to take some photos of stars and the houses in the mountain. The photos aren't modified. We were trying to test exposition time and contrast.

- (2021/02/03) The sky was clear for about 2 hour straight. We take some photos of Perseo constellation. I'm still in the process of processing the photos in DeepSkyStacker. Then I'm planning to use Photoshop to improve the quality of the image. However, here goes a pic that shows some of the brightest stars of Perseo.
