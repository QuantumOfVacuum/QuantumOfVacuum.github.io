## About Me

My name is Ayush Singh and I am currently a physics major in the
integrated master's programme at [National Institute of Science Education and Research](https://www.niser.ac.in/), Bhubaneswar, India.  I like
abstract math, its applications to physics, and I write [code](https://github.com/11DE784A/) in my free time.

I can be contacted via email, but may not
reply instantly. If you want to send me a GPG encrypted email, find my [public
key here](/assets/files/gpg_public.asc). To receive an encrypted response, send
me your public key.  

For academic details see [my CV](/assets/files/cv_ayush_singh.pdf).
